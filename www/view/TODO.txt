- Online/Offline till visit is "In Progress"
- If Visit is in "In Progress" then make device offline..
- Create all records in offline i.e. 
    Task, ... Done
    Alerts, ... Done
    Contacts, ... Done
    Attachments, 
    Signature, 
    Action, 
    Inspection, 
    Inspection Item, 
    Analysis, 
    Prep/Waste, 
    Visit,
    Quotes,
    QuoteLineItems etc.
- When user clicks on "Complete Visit".. Upload the all records related to any visit to salesforce...???????
- Make Sure Visit request is last to go on salesforce
- Make sure event listner for Onilne/Offline states works depending on Current Visit Status..
- Make Sure if user is not on visit and related data Inspection/Action etc, then event listner for Online/Offline should work as expected.

- Add another public variable isCurrentVisitInProgress ??? and then add the variable to if conditions.. 
  by default value will be false. 
==========================================================================
- When user press on "Refresh All Data" it should perform as it is..
UpdateStatusOfVisit
    -> ChangeVisitStatus()
ConfirmationDialogVisitDetailStatusChange
    -> ChangeVisitStatus()


updateVisit() -> Is called to update the visit data expect status  

CompleteVisit==1 ??


[
What if ChangeVisitStatus() got executed in offline  and app comes online updateVisit() is executed in online mode.
This can revert the completed visit to previous status. 
]

- UpdateResourceGeolocation
- UpdateGeolocation

=> CompleteVisit


=============
Need to double think on these pages for isCurrentVisitInProgress condition

ShowVisitsMap.html
